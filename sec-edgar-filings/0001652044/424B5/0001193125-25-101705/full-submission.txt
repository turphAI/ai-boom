Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;), trades in the secondary market are generally required to settle in one business day, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to
trade notes on any day prior to the business date before delivery will be required, by virtue of the fact that the notes initially settle in T+4, to specify an alternate settlement arrangement at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed
settlement and should consult their own advisors. See &#147;Underwriting.&#148; </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">An investment in the notes involves certain risks. You should carefully consider the risk factors described under &#147;Risk Factors&#148; in our 2024 Annual
Report and as described in the Q1 2025 Quarterly Report, as well as the other information included or incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus, before making an investment decision. Additional risks and
uncertainties not now known to us or that we now deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business or financial performance. Our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected by any of
these risks. The market or trading price of the notes could decline due to any of these risks or other factors, and you may lose all or part of your investment. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to the foregoing risks relating to us, the following are additional risks relating to an investment in the notes. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>The notes are unsecured and are effectively subordinated to our secured debt. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The notes are our unsecured general obligations. Holders of our secured indebtedness, if any, will have claims that are prior to your claims as holders of the
notes, to the extent of the assets securing such indebtedness. Thus, in the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or similar proceeding, our pledged assets would be available to satisfy obligations of our secured
indebtedness before any payment could be made on the notes. To the extent that such assets cannot satisfy in full our secured indebtedness, the holders of such indebtedness would have a claim for any shortfall that would rank equally in right of
payment with the notes. In any of the foregoing events, we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient assets to pay amounts due on the notes. As a result, holders of the notes may receive less, ratably, than holders of our secured indebtedness.
As of March&nbsp;31, 2025, Alphabet Inc. on a standalone basis had no secured indebtedness outstanding. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>The notes are structurally subordinated to
the existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We conduct most of our operations through our subsidiaries, which are separate and
distinct legal entities from us. The notes are exclusively our obligations and are not guaranteed by our subsidiaries, which have no obligation to pay any amounts due on the notes or to provide us with funds to meet our payment obligations on the
notes, whether in the form of dividends, distributions, loans or other payments. Our subsidiaries are not prohibited from incurring additional debt or other liabilities, including senior indebtedness, or from issuing equity interests that have
priority over our interests in the subsidiaries. Consequently, the notes will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of any of our subsidiaries and any subsidiaries that we may in the future acquire or establish. As of
March&nbsp;31, 2025, Google and certain other subsidiaries had approximately $2.1&nbsp;billion in finance lease obligations and no long-term debt outstanding. Additionally, as of March&nbsp;31, 2025, we have entered into leases primarily related to
data centers that have not yet commenced with future lease payments of $17.3&nbsp;billion, that are not yet recorded on our consolidated balance sheets, a portion of which will represent finance lease obligations. As of March&nbsp;31, 2025, the
notes would have been structurally subordinated to such existing third-party debt. If our subsidiaries were to incur additional debt or liabilities or to issue equity interests that have priority over our interests in our subsidiaries, our ability
to pay our obligations on the notes could be adversely affected. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, any payment of dividends, loans or advances by our subsidiaries could be
subject to statutory or contractual restrictions. Payments to us by our subsidiaries will also be contingent upon the subsidiaries&#146; earnings and business considerations. Our right to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries upon their
bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization, and therefore the right of the holders of the notes to participate in those assets, will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary&#146;s creditors, including trade creditors. In
addition, even if we are a creditor of any of our subsidiaries, our rights as a creditor would be subordinate to any security interest in the assets of our subsidiaries and any indebtedness of our subsidiaries senior to that held by us. </P>

and in other relevant countries. Foreign currency exchange rates may be affected by, among other factors, existing and expected rates of inflation, existing and expected interest rate levels, the balance of payments between countries, and the extent
of the governmental surpluses or deficits in various countries. All of these factors are, in turn, sensitive to the monetary, fiscal and trade policies pursued by the governments of various countries important to international trade and finance.
Moreover, the recent global economic volatility and the actions taken or to be taken by various national governments in response to the volatility could significantly affect the exchange rates between the euro and the investor&#146;s home currency.

law, a New York state court rendering a judgment on the notes would be required to render the judgment in euros. However, the judgment would be converted into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of entry of the judgment.
Consequently, in a lawsuit for payment on the notes, investors would bear currency exchange risk until a New York state court judgment is entered, which could be a significant amount of time. A federal court sitting in New York with diversity
jurisdiction over a dispute arising in connection with the notes would apply New York law. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In courts outside of New York, investors may not be able to
obtain a judgment in a currency other than U.S. dollars. For example, a judgment for money in an action based on the notes in many other U.S. federal or state courts ordinarily would be enforced in the United States only in U.S. dollars. The date
used to determine the rate of conversion of euros into U.S. dollars would depend upon various factors, including which court renders the judgment and when the judgment is rendered. </P>

only. Unless and until the notes in definitive registered form are issued in exchange for book-entry interests, owners of book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of the notes. The common depositary (or its nominee) for the
accounts of Clearstream and Euroclear will be the registered holder of the global notes. Payments in respect of the global notes representing the notes (including principal, premium, if any, interest and additional amounts, if any) will be made to
the paying agent. The paying agent will then make such payments to the common depositary (or its nominee) for Clearstream and Euroclear. The common depositary (or its nominee) will in turn distribute such payments to participants in accordance with
its procedures. After payment to the common depositary (or its nominee), we, the trustee and the paying agent will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests.
Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest, you must rely on the procedures of Clearstream or Euroclear, as applicable, and if you are not a participant in Clearstream or Euroclear, on the procedures of the participant through which you own your
interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of notes under the indenture. See &#147;Description of the Notes&#151;Book-Entry; Delivery and Settlement&#151;Global Clearance and Settlement.&#148; Payments in respect of the global

for waivers or other actions from holders of the notes. Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear or Clearstream or, if applicable, a
participant. There can be no assurance that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any request actions on a timely basis. </P>

will be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the notes. See &#147;Description of the Notes&#151;Book-Entry; Delivery and Settlement&#151;Global Clearance and Settlement.&#148; </P>

</B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The following is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to a holder of a note. This summary is based
on provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;), applicable U.S. Treasury regulations, laws, rulings and decisions now in effect, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. This
summary deals only with beneficial owners of notes that will hold notes as capital assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes and acquired notes upon original issuance at their issue price. This summary does not address particular tax
considerations that may be applicable to investors that are subject to special tax rules, such as banks, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">tax-exempt</FONT> entities, insurance companies, regulated investment companies, dealers in securities or
currencies, traders in securities electing to mark to market their securities for U.S. federal income tax purposes, persons that will hold notes as a position in a &#147;straddle&#148; or conversion transaction, or as part of a &#147;synthetic
security&#148; or other integrated financial transaction, entities taxed as partnerships or the partners therein, U.S. expatriates, nonresident alien individuals present in the United States for more than 182 days in a taxable year, or U.S. holders
(as defined below) that have a &#147;functional currency&#148; other than the U.S. dollar. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This summary addresses only U.S. federal income tax
consequences, and does not address consequences arising under state, local or <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-U.S.</FONT> tax laws, the alternative minimum tax or the Medicare tax on net investment income or under special timing rules
prescribed under section 451(b) of the Code. Investors should consult their own tax advisors in determining the tax consequences to them of holding notes under such tax laws, as well as the application to their particular situation of the U.S.
federal income tax considerations discussed below. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As used herein, a &#147;U.S. holder&#148; is a beneficial owner of a note that is, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, a citizen or resident of the United States or a domestic corporation or that otherwise is subject to U.S. federal income taxation on a net income basis in respect of the note. A
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">&#147;non-U.S.</FONT> holder&#148; is a beneficial owner of a note that is an individual, corporation, estate, or trust that is, in each case, not a U.S. holder. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Payments of stated interest will be taxable to a U.S. holder as ordinary interest income at the time that such payments are accrued or are actually or
constructively received (in accordance with the U.S. holder&#146;s method of tax accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes). It is expected, and this discussion assumes, that the notes will not be issued with original issue discount
(&#147;OID&#148;) in an amount equal to or in excess of a <I>de minimis </I>amount for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, however, if the notes are issued with OID that is equal to or more than a <I>de minimis </I>amount, regardless of a
U.S. holder&#146;s regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the U.S. holder will be required to include OID as ordinary gross income under a &#147;constant yield method&#148; before the receipt of cash attributable to such
income. OID generally will be accrued in euros and translated into dollars at the average exchange rate in effect during the interest accrual period (or portion thereof within the holder&#146;s taxable year). The U.S. holder generally will recognize
foreign currency gain or loss to the extent the amount accrued differs from the U.S. dollar value of the euros amounts when received. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A U.S. holder that
uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that receives a payment of interest on a note will be required to include in ordinary income the U.S. dollar value of the euros interest payment determined based on the
exchange rate in effect on the date the payment is received, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars. A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will accrue interest
income on a note in euros and translate the amount accrued into U.S. dollars based on the average exchange rate in effect during the interest accrual period (or portion thereof within the holder&#146;s taxable year), or at the holder&#146;s
election, at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the accrual period (or the last day of the taxable year within such accrual period if the accrual period spans more than one taxable year), or at the spot rate of exchange on the date of
receipt, if that date is </P>

within five business days of the last day of the accrual period. A U.S. holder that makes this election must apply it consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot change the
election without the consent of the Internal Revenue Service (the &#147;IRS&#148;). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A U.S. holder who uses the accrual method will recognize foreign
currency gain or loss, as the case may be, on the receipt of an interest payment made with respect to a note (including amounts received upon the sale of a note attributable to accrued interest previously included in income as described below under
&#147;&#151;Sale, Exchange, Redemption or Retirement of Notes&#148;) if the exchange rate in effect on the date the payment is received differs from the rate applicable to a previous accrual of that interest income. This foreign currency gain or
loss will generally be treated as ordinary income or loss and will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income received on the note. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Sale,
Exchange, Redemption or Retirement of Notes </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Upon the sale, exchange, redemption or retirement of a note, a U.S. holder generally will recognize
gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale, exchange, redemption or retirement (less any accrued but unpaid interest, which will be taxable as ordinary interest income as described above) and the U.S. holder&#146;s
tax basis in such note. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A U.S. holder&#146;s tax basis in a note generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the purchase price of that note on the date
of purchase. The amount realized upon the sale, exchange, redemption or retirement of a note will be the U.S. dollar value of the currency received calculated at the exchange rate in effect on the date the instrument is sold, exchanged, redeemed or
retired. If the notes are treated as traded on an established securities market, a U.S. holder who uses the cash method, and if it so elects, a U.S. holder who uses the accrual method, will determine the U.S. dollar value of the amount realized by
translating such amount at the spot rate on the settlement date of the sale. The election available to U.S. holders who use the accrual method in respect of the purchase and sale of notes traded on an established securities market must be applied
consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors about the availability of this treatment (and in the case of accrual basis U.S. holders,
the advisability of making this election). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder generally will
be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder has held the note for more than one year at the time of disposition. Long-term capital gains recognized by an individual holder generally are subject to tax at a lower rate than short-term capital
gains or ordinary income. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder on the sale, exchange,
redemption or retirement of a note generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss to the extent that the gain or loss is attributable to changes in exchange rates during the period in which the U.S. holder held the note. This foreign currency
gain or loss will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income received on the note. In addition, upon the sale, exchange, redemption or retirement of a note, a U.S. holder that uses the accrual method may realize foreign currency gain or loss
attributable to amounts received in respect of accrued and unpaid interest. The amount of foreign currency gain or loss realized with respect to principal and accrued interest will, however, be limited to the amount of overall gain or loss realized
on the disposition. For a U.S. holder that uses the accrual method and does not make the election described above, the foreign currency gain or loss may include amounts attributable to changes in exchange rates between the trade date and the
settlement date. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Reportable Transactions </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A

(the &#147;FTT&#148;) in Austria, Belgium, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain (the &#147;Participating Member States&#148;). Political consensus on a final directive for the FTT has not yet been achieved

enacted, the FTT could apply under certain circumstances to transactions involving the notes. The mechanism by which the FTT would be applied and collected is not yet known, but if the FTT or any similar tax is adopted, transactions in the notes
could be subject to higher costs, and the liquidity of the market for the notes may be diminished. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Prospective holders of the notes are advised to seek

for any series of the notes. The underwriters have advised us that they intend to make a market in the notes, but they are not obligated to do so. The underwriters may discontinue any market making in the notes at any time at their sole discretion.

affect future trading prices of the notes offered hereby. The underwriters and their respective affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or instruments and

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of the DGCL could have the effect of delaying, deferring, or discouraging
another party from acquiring control of us. In particular, our capital structure concentrates ownership of our voting stock in the hands of Larry, Sergey, and Eric. These provisions, which are summarized below, are expected to discourage coercive
takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids. These provisions are also designed to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to first negotiate with our board of directors. However, these provisions could also have the effect of
discouraging others from attempting hostile takeovers and, as a consequence, they may also inhibit temporary fluctuations in the market price of our Class&nbsp;A Common Stock or Class&nbsp;C Capital Stock that often result from actual or rumored
hostile takeover attempts. These provisions may also have the effect of preventing changes in our management. It is possible that these provisions could make it more difficult to accomplish transactions that stockholders may otherwise deem to be in
their best interests. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Three Classes of Stock </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As discussed above, our Class&nbsp;B Common Stock has 10 votes per share, while our Class&nbsp;A Common Stock has one vote per share and our
Class&nbsp;C Capital Stock has no voting rights (unless otherwise required by law). As a result of their ownership of a substantial portion of our Class&nbsp;B Common Stock, Larry and Sergey currently have the ability to elect all of our directors
and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted for a vote of our stockholders. This concentrated voting control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover, or other change of control transaction that other
stockholders may view as beneficial. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Because the Class&nbsp;C Capital Stock has no voting rights (except as required by law), the
issuance of Class&nbsp;C Capital Stock will not result in voting dilution to the holders of shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock or Class&nbsp;B Common Stock. As a result, the issuance of Class&nbsp;C Capital Stock could prolong the duration of Larry
and Sergey&#146;s current relative ownership of our voting power and their ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So long as Larry and Sergey have the ability to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, third parties
may be deterred in their willingness to make an unsolicited merger, takeover, or other change of control proposal, or to engage in a proxy contest for the election of directors. As a result, our three classes of stock may have the effect of
depriving our stockholders of an opportunity to sell their shares at a premium over prevailing market prices and make it more difficult to replace our directors and management. </P>

or proposals regarding business to be conducted at a special or annual meeting of the stockholders. However, our bylaws may have the effect of precluding the conduct of certain business at a meeting if the proper procedures are not followed. These

that short position by purchasing securities in the open market or as otherwise provided in the applicable prospectus supplement. The underwriters also may impose a penalty bid on certain underwriters. This means that if the underwriters purchase
the securities in the open market to reduce the underwriters&#146; short position or to stabilize the price of the securities, they may reclaim the amount of the selling concession from the underwriters who sold those securities as part of the
offering. In general, purchases of a security for the purpose of stabilization or to reduce a short position could cause the price of the security to be higher than it might be in the absence of such purchases. The imposition of a penalty bid might
also have an effect on the price of a security to the extent that it were to discourage resales of the security. The underwriters are not required to engage in these activities and may end any of these activities at any time. </P>
