<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">An investment in the notes involves certain risks. You should carefully consider the risk factors described under &#147;Risk Factors&#148; in our 2015 Annual
Report, as well as the other information included or incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus, before making an investment decision. Additional risks and uncertainties not now known to us or that we now
deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business or financial performance. Our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. The market or trading price of the
notes could decline due to any of these risks or other factors, and you may lose all or part of your investment. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to the foregoing risks
relating to us, the following are additional risks relating to an investment in the notes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>The notes are unsecured and are effectively subordinated
to our secured debt. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The notes are our unsecured general obligations. Holders of our secured indebtedness, if any, will have claims that are prior
to your claims as holders of the notes, to the extent of the assets securing such indebtedness. Thus, in the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or similar proceeding, our pledged assets would be available to satisfy
obligations of our secured indebtedness before any payment could be made on the notes. To the extent that such assets cannot satisfy in full our secured indebtedness, the holders of such indebtedness would have a claim for any shortfall that would
rank equally in right of payment with the notes. In any of the foregoing events, we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient assets to pay amounts due on the notes. As a result, holders of the notes may receive less, ratably, than holders of
our secured indebtedness. As of June 30, 2016, Alphabet Inc. on a standalone basis had no secured indebtedness outstanding. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>The notes are
structurally subordinated to the existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We conduct most of our operations through our subsidiaries,
which are separate and distinct legal entities from us.&nbsp;The notes are exclusively our obligations and are not guaranteed by our subsidiaries, which have no obligation to pay any amounts due on the notes or to provide us with funds to meet our
payment obligations on the notes, whether in the form of dividends, distributions, loans or other payments.&nbsp;Our subsidiaries are not prohibited from incurring additional debt or other liabilities, including senior indebtedness, or from issuing
equity interests that have priority over our interests in the subsidiaries.&nbsp;Consequently, the notes are structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of any of our subsidiaries and any subsidiaries that we may in the future
acquire or establish.&nbsp;As of June 30, 2016, Google had approximately $0.5 billion in long-term debt and capital lease borrowing debts. As of June 30, 2016, the notes would have been structurally subordinated to such existing third-party debt. If
our subsidiaries were to incur additional debt or liabilities or to issue equity interests that have priority over our interests in our subsidiaries, our ability to pay our obligations on the notes could be adversely affected.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, any payment of dividends, loans or advances by our subsidiaries could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions. Payments to us by our
subsidiaries will also be contingent upon the subsidiaries&#146; earnings and business considerations. Our right to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries upon their bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization, and therefore the right of the
holders of the notes to participate in those assets, will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary&#146;s creditors, including trade creditors. In addition, even if we are a creditor of any of our subsidiaries, our rights as a
creditor would be subordinate to any security interest in the assets of our subsidiaries and any indebtedness of our subsidiaries senior to that held by us. See &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations&#151;Capital Resources and Liquidity&#148; and Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016, which is incorporated by

under the indenture referred to below and will be issued only in fully registered form in minimum denominations of $2,000 and multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. The notes will mature on the date set forth below. The accompanying prospectus
describes additional provisions of the notes and of the indenture, dated as of February 12, 2016, between us and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee, under which we will issue the notes. There is no limit on the aggregate
principal amount of notes that we may issue under the indenture. We reserve the right, from time to time and without the consent of any holders of the notes, to re-open such series of notes on terms identical in all respects to the outstanding notes
of such series (except for the date of issuance, the date interest begins to accrue and, in certain circumstances, the first interest payment date), so that such additional notes will be consolidated with, form a single series with and increase the
aggregate principal amount of the notes of such series; provided that the additional notes will have one or more separate CUSIP numbers unless: (i) the additional notes and the outstanding notes of the original series are treated as part of the same
&#147;issue&#148; of debt instruments for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (ii) the additional notes are issued pursuant to a &#147;qualified reopening&#148; of the outstanding notes of the original series for U.S. federal income tax purposes or
(iii) the additional notes are, and the outstanding notes of the original series were, issued without original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such additional notes will have the same terms as to ranking, redemption, waivers,
amendments or otherwise, as the applicable series of notes, and will vote together as one class on all matters with respect to such series of notes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The

made on the books of DTC participants acting on behalf of beneficial owners. You will not receive written confirmation from DTC of your purchase. The direct or indirect participants through whom you purchased the notes should send you written
confirmations providing details of your transactions, as well as periodic statements of your holdings. The direct and indirect participants are responsible for keeping accurate account of the holdings of their customers like you. The laws of some
states require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. Such limits and such laws may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge beneficial interests in the global notes. </P>

credit the accounts of DTC&#146;s direct participants with payment in amounts proportionate to their respective holdings in principal amount of beneficial interest in a security as shown on the records of DTC, unless DTC has reason to believe that
it will not receive payment on the payment date. The underwriters will initially designate the accounts to be credited. Beneficial owners may experience delays in receiving distributions on their notes because distributions will initially be made to
DTC and they must be transferred through the chain of intermediaries to the beneficial owner&#146;s account. Payments by DTC participants to you will be the responsibility of the DTC participant and not of DTC, the trustee or us. Accordingly,
neither we, the trustee or any paying agent will have any responsibility or liability for: any aspect of DTC&#146;s records relating to, or payments made on account of, beneficial ownership interests in notes represented by a global securities

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The following is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to a holder of a note. This summary is based on laws,
regulations, rulings and decisions now in effect, all of which are subject to change. This summary deals only with beneficial owners of notes that will hold notes as capital assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and does not address
particular tax considerations that may be applicable to investors that are subject to special tax rules, such as banks, tax-exempt entities, insurance companies, regulated investment companies, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in
securities electing to mark to market, persons that will hold notes as a position in a &#147;straddle&#148; or conversion transaction, or as part of a &#147;synthetic security&#148; or other integrated financial transaction, entities taxed as
partnerships or the partners therein, persons subject to the alternative minimum tax, U.S. expatriates, nonresident alien individuals present in the United States for more than 182 days in a taxable year, or U.S. holders (as defined below) that have
a &#147;functional currency&#148; other than the U.S. dollar. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This summary addresses only U.S. federal income tax consequences, and does not address
consequences arising under state, local or foreign tax laws or the Medicare tax on net investment income.&nbsp;Investors should consult their own tax advisors in determining the tax consequences to them of holding notes under such tax laws, as well
as the application to their particular situation of the U.S. federal income tax considerations discussed below. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As used herein, a &#147;U.S. holder&#148;
is a beneficial owner of a note that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a citizen or resident of the United States or a domestic corporation or that otherwise is subject to U.S. federal income taxation on a net income basis in respect of the
note. A &#147;non-U.S. holder&#148; is a beneficial owner of a note that is an individual, corporation, estate, or trust that is, in each case, not a U.S. holder. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>U.S. Holders </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Payments of Interest </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Payments of stated interest will be taxable to a U.S. holder as ordinary interest income at the time that such payments are accrued or are received (in
accordance with the U.S. holder&#146;s method of tax accounting). It is expected, and this discussion assumes, that the notes will not be issued with original issue discount (&#147;OID&#148;) in an amount equal to or in excess of a de minimis
amount. In general, however, if the notes are issued with OID that is equal to or more than a de minimis amount, regardless of a U.S. holder&#146;s regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the U.S. holder will have to
include OID as ordinary gross income under a &#147;constant yield method&#148; before the receipt of cash attributable to such income. <B> </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Sale, Exchange, Redemption or Retirement of notes </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Upon the sale, exchange, redemption or retirement of a note, a U.S. holder generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount
realized on the sale, exchange, redemption or retirement (less any accrued but unpaid interest, which will be taxable as ordinary interest income as described above) and the U.S. holder&#146;s tax basis in such note. A U.S. holder&#146;s tax basis
in a note generally will equal the cost of such note to such holder. Gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder has owned the note for more than one year at the time of disposition.
Long-term capital gains recognized by an individual holder generally are subject to tax at a lower rate than short-term capital gains or ordinary income.&nbsp;The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. </P>

returns will be filed with the IRS in connection with payments on the notes made to, and the proceeds of dispositions of notes effected by, certain U.S. taxpayers. In addition, certain U.S. taxpayers may be subject to backup withholding in respect
of such amounts if they do not provide their taxpayer identification numbers to the person from whom they receive payments or otherwise comply with applicable requirements. Non-U.S. taxpayers may be required to comply with applicable certification
procedures to establish that they are not U.S. taxpayers in order to avoid the application of such information reporting requirements and backup withholding. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a U.S. or non-U.S. taxpayer will be
allowed as a credit against the holder&#146;s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle the holder to a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. </P>

Account Tax Compliance Act (&#147;FATCA&#148;), a holder of notes will generally be subject to 30% U.S. withholding tax on interest payments on the notes (and, starting on January 1, 2019, principal payments on the notes and gross proceeds from the
sale or other taxable disposition of the notes) if the holder is not FATCA compliant or holds its notes through a foreign financial institution that is not FATCA compliant, unless an exemption applies. In order to be treated as FATCA compliant, a
holder must provide us or an applicable withholding agent certain documentation (usually an IRS Form W-9, W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E) containing information about its identity, its FATCA status, and if required, its direct and indirect U.S. owners. For a
foreign financial institution to be FATCA compliant, it generally must enter into an agreement with the U.S. government to report, on an annual basis, certain information regarding accounts with or interests in the institution held by certain United
States persons and by certain non-U.S. entities that are wholly or partially owned by United States persons, or must satisfy similar requirements under an intergovernmental agreement between the United States and another country (an
&#147;IGA&#148;). These requirements may be modified by the adoption or implementation of a particular IGA or by future U.S. Treasury Regulations. If any taxes were to be deducted or withheld from any payments in respect of the notes as a result of
a beneficial owner or intermediary&#146;s failure to comply with the foregoing rules, no additional amounts will be paid on the notes as a result of the deduction or withholding of such tax. Prospective investors should consult their own tax
advisers about how FATCA may apply to their investment in the notes. </P>

another party from acquiring control of us. In particular, our capital structure concentrates ownership of our voting stock in the hands of Larry, Sergey, and Eric. These provisions, which are summarized below, are expected to discourage coercive
takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids. These provisions are also designed to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to first negotiate with our board of directors. However, these provisions could also have the effect of
discouraging others from attempting hostile takeovers and, as a consequence, they may also inhibit temporary fluctuations in the market price of our Class&nbsp;A Common Stock or Class C Capital Stock that often result from actual or rumored hostile
takeover attempts. These provisions may also have the effect of preventing changes in our management. It is possible that these provisions could make it more difficult to accomplish transactions that stockholders may otherwise deem to be in their
best interests. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Three Classes of Stock </I></B></P>

Capital Stock has no voting rights (unless otherwise required by law). As a result of their ownership of a substantial portion of our Class B Common Stock, Larry and Sergey currently have the ability to elect all of our directors and to determine
the outcome of most matters submitted for a vote of our stockholders. This concentrated voting control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover, or other change of control transaction that other stockholders may view as
beneficial. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Because the Class C Capital Stock has no voting rights (except as required by law), the issuance of Class C Capital Stock
will not result in voting dilution to the holders of shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock. As a result, the issuance of Class C Capital Stock could prolong the duration of Larry and Sergey&#146;s current relative ownership of
our voting power and their ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So long as Larry and Sergey have the ability to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, third parties
may be deterred in their willingness to make an unsolicited merger, takeover, or other change of control proposal, or to engage in a proxy contest for the election of directors. As a result, our three classes of stock may have the effect of
depriving our stockholders of an opportunity to sell their shares at a premium over prevailing market prices and make it more difficult to replace our directors and management. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with underwritten offerings of the offered securities and in accordance with applicable law and industry practice, the
underwriters in certain circumstances are permitted to engage in certain transactions that stabilize the price of the securities. Such transactions consist of bids or purchases for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the
securities. If the underwriters create a short position in the securities in connection with the offering (<I>i.e.</I>, if they sell more securities than are set forth on the cover page of the applicable prospectus supplement), the underwriters may
reduce that short position by purchasing securities in the open market or as otherwise provided in the applicable prospectus supplement. The underwriters also may impose a penalty bid on certain underwriters. This means that if the underwriters
purchase the securities in the open market to reduce the underwriters&#146; short position or to stabilize the price of the securities, they may reclaim the amount of the selling concession from the underwriters who sold those securities as part of
the offering. In general, purchases of a security for the purpose of stabilization or to reduce a short position could cause the price of the security to be higher than it might be in the absence of such purchases. The imposition of a penalty bid
might also have an effect on the price of a security to the extent that it were to discourage resales of the security. The underwriters are not required to engage in these activities and may end any of these activities at any time. </P>

securities covered by this prospectus and the applicable prospectus supplement, including in short sale transactions, or may lend securities in order to facilitate short sale transactions by others. If so, the third party may use securities pledged
by us or borrowed from us or others to settle those sales or to close out any related open borrowings of securities, and may use securities received from us in settlement of those derivative or hedging transactions to close out any related open
borrowings of securities. The third party in such sale transactions will be an underwriter and will be identified in the applicable prospectus supplement (or a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">post-effective</FONT> amendment to the registration
